	     <big > <hr> <em>In the aftermath of the July 15, 2016, coup attempt, the    Turkish government arrested, detained, sacked or tortured hundreds of thousands of innocent people in the arbitrary name of rooting out "terrorism." Included in that group were at least 864 babies and infants who have become political prisoners along with their mothers, living in unhealthy conditions and denied their rights to nutrition, food and access to basic healthcare.</em><hr></big>

It would seem that Turkey's one-man-rule system knows no limits despite its economic cost, dissent within the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), and international criticism. But to liberal Turks and to Western observers, such a trend looks utterly unsustainable. In a democracy, leaders and systems are not forever.." Marc Pierini</div>
